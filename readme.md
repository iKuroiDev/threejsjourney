# Three.js Journey
This is a repository for all the code used in the Three.js Journey course by Bruno Simon. 
Here I keep track of all the classes I did, as well as some of my own tests, as there's not better way to practice than to mess with the code and explore beyond of what a course provides :)

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
